The flight exploded shortly after takeoff, killing all 21 people on board. Authorities are seeking information that may pertain to possible suspect(s) and the crime that occurred aboard this flight. All deceased passengers and crew in the Flight 00901 crash were claimed, except one. A body has possibly been identified as Ali Hawa Jamal. He is suspected of carrying the bomb aboard the aircraft.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>According to reports, an unidentified Middle Eastern male used the stolen credit card of a US citizen to rent a Mazda 4x4 at a Vantage Rent-a-Car located in Panama City, Panama, on May 27, 1994. The next day the same unidentified individual called the car rental agency and stated he wanted to rent a second car, a Jeep Cherokee 4x4, as his friend was using the initial car that was rented. The individual charged both cars to the stolen credit card. Both cars were later found abandoned near Tocumen Airport in Panama City, Panama.  </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>On  May 28, 1994,  it was further reported that possibly the same Middle Eastern male utilizing the same stolen credit card, purchased a two-line telephone system from a Panamanian business. Ali Hawa Jamal had a Motorola Radio P-500 radio with him during the ill-fated flight of Alas Chiricanas Airlines Flight 00901.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>It is unknown if the unknown Middle Eastern males were associates of Ali Hawa Jamal. The unknown males are believed to have traveled to Colombia, Venezuela, Costa Rica and Lebanon. It is suspected that the Middle Eastern males were in contact with individuals in the region that has been linked to weapons traffickers. The Sidon, Lebanon based terrorist group Ansar Allah expressed support for the bombing through multiple media outlets. It is suspected that the attack was linked  to a terrorist group or groups allied with Ansar Allah's political beliefs.</p>",

            "caution": "<p>John Anthony Porcaro is wanted for his alleged involvement in a South Florida telemarketing scheme which defrauded more than 400 individuals throughout the United States out of more than $5 million. Between February and December of 1998, the Trump Financial Group and the Sheffield Group were doing business as telemarketing firms which obtained money from investors for purported investment in foreign currency options in the foreign exchange markets. It is alleged that investors were promised as much as 700 percent returns based upon the rise and fall of the value of foreign currencies in relation to the value of the United States Dollar.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Investors rarely, if ever, received returns on their investments and money raised from investors allegedly was used for the personal benefit of the firms' principal employees and telemarketers who sold investments. A substantial amount of the money also was transferred to offshore bank accounts in the Cayman Islands.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>On October 21, 2003, a federal indictment was filed by the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, charging Porcaro, and others who are no longer at large, with multiple counts of wire fraud, mail fraud, and money laundering. A federal warrant remains outstanding for the arrest of Porcaro.</p>",

The individuals believed that they were investing in the short-term purchase and sale of residential mortgage loans, promising 50% returns. Instead, Elbarki allegedly misappropriated the investors' funds for personal use.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>On December 11, 2008, Elbarki was indicted federally by the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida at Miami, Florida, for wire fraud and securities fraud.
